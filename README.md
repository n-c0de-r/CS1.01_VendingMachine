Description from the project:
 WendingMachine models a naive wending machine that dispenses some snacks.
 Git user n-c0de-r updated this naive machine to an improved one, for
 showcasing purposes. This improved machine only accepts certain coins and
 will return inappropriate amounts and set prices right as n-c0de-r
 implemented all guards needed to solve that. Compared to the original
 machine, this has a few extra methods to do so correctly. The price of a
 snack is specified via the constructor.

  Based on the original by David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling
