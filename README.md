Description from the project:
  TicketMachine models a naive ticket machine that issues
  flat-fare tickets. Git user n-c0de-r uprated this naive
  machine to an improved one, for showcase purposes.
  This improved machine only accepts certain coins and
  will return inapropriate amounts and set prices right
  as n-c0de-r implemented all guards needed to solve that.
  Compared to the original machine, this has a few extra
  methods to do so correctly.
  The price of a ticket is specified via the constructor.
