/**
 * VendingMachine models a naive vending machine that dispenses some snacks.
 * Git user n-c0de-r updated this naive machine to an improved one, for
 * showcasing purposes. This improved machine only accepts certain coins and
 * will return inappropriate amounts and set prices right as n-c0de-r
 * implemented all guards needed to solve that. Compared to the original
 * machine, this has a few extra methods to do so correctly. The price of a
 * snack is specified via the constructor. This can still be improved!
